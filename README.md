## API Reference
The following routes are available in the application:

 ## Libraries
*	isLoggedIn.js:
This is a custom middleware function that checks if there is a logged-in user or not. If there is no logged-in user, it redirects the user to the sign-in page. Otherwise, it moves to the next step.
*	passportConfig.js:
This file configures passport, a Node.js library used for authentication. It uses a local strategy to authenticate users. Passport stores the user's ID in the session, so it doesn't need to deserialize the entire user object with every request. The code defines the serializeUser() and deserializeUser() methods for storing and retrieving the user ID from the session. It also defines the local strategy for authenticating users with their email address and password. The code uses the User model to search for a user with the given email address and then verifies the password using the verifyPassword() method defined in the User model.
